The Biden Administration,  I’m writing to urge the Federal Government to be expansive in its rule minimizing the risk of climate change in federal acquisitions. Climate experts say that we must reduce our carbon emissions dramatically to avoid the worst ravages of the climate crisis. The Federal Government has a unique ability to create market standards through its procurement process. It has a responsibility to make those standards as strong as possible. By making sure that federal purchasing dollars go to greener buildings and materials, lower- and zero-emission vehicles, and other more sustainable purchases, President Biden and his administration can provide a needed boost in the transition to a clean energy economy and incentivize the private sector to move in a more sustainable direction.  The 2018 National Climate Assessment found that the climate crisis could slash about a tenth of our economy by the end of the century. That economic contraction dwarfs any negative impact that strong climate procurement standards could have on an individual firm.  We must use every tool in the toolbox to fight the climate crisis. I support President Biden’s rule.  Terrence Thompson actionjack12165@yahoo.com 17224 133rd Ave APT 5D Jamaica, New York 11434-3902

The Biden Administration,  I’m writing to urge the Federal Government to be expansive in its rule minimizing the risk of climate change in federal acquisitions.   As an Arizonan, I'm experiencing first-hand the devastating heat, wildfires, and drought caused by climate change.  As a citizen of the Cherokee Nation, I'm deeply concerned about the terrible impact of climate change on the next seven generations.  It's my responsibility and the responsibility of EVERYONE, especially the government, to ensure we give them a world in which they can survive.

The Biden Administration,  I’m writing to urge the Federal Government to be expansive in its rule minimizing the risk of climate change in federal acquisitions. Climate experts say that we must reduce our carbon emissions dramatically to avoid the worst ravages of the climate crisis. The Federal Government has a unique ability to create market standards through its procurement process. It has a responsibility to make those standards as strong as possible. By making sure that federal purchasing dollars go to greener buildings and materials, lower- and zero-emission vehicles, and other more sustainable purchases, President Biden and his administration can provide a needed boost in the transition to a clean energy economy and incentivize the private sector to move in a more sustainable direction.  The 2018 National Climate Assessment found that the climate crisis could slash about a tenth of our economy by the end of the century. That economic contraction dwarfs any negative impact that strong climate procurement standards could have on an individual firm.  We must use every tool in the toolbox to fight the climate crisis.

The Biden Administration,  I’m writing to urge the Federal Government to be expansive in its rule minimizing the risk of climate change in federal acquisitions. Climate experts say that we must reduce our carbon emissions dramatically to avoid the worst ravages of the climate crisis. The Federal Government has a unique ability to create market standards through its procurement process. It has a responsibility to make those standards as strong as possible. By making sure that federal purchasing dollars go to greener buildings and materials, lower- and zero-emission vehicles, and other more sustainable purchases, President Biden and his administration can provide a needed boost in the transition to a clean energy economy and incentivize the private sector to move in a more sustainable direction.  The 2018 National Climate Assessment found that the climate crisis could slash about a tenth of our economy by the end of the century. That economic contraction dwarfs any negative impact that strong climate procurement standards could have on an individual firm.  We must use every tool in the toolbox to fight the climate crisis.

The Biden Administration,  I don't believe it will do any good, but still I’m writing to urge the federal government to be expansive in its rule minimizing the risk of global warming ("climate change") in federal acquisitions.  Climate experts say that we must reduce our carbon emissions dramatically to avoid the worst ravages of the climate crisis, but President Biden seems unconcerned with the crisis--except rhetorically--and firmly committed to the fossil fuel industry, as he always has been.  The federal government has an unique ability to create market standards through its procurement process, although the will to do so appears to be entirely lacking.  It has a responsibility (not that it takes its responsibilities to ordinary people or the environment at all seriously) to make those standards as strong as possible.  By making sure that federal purchasing dollars go to greener buildings and materials, lower- and zero-emission vehicles, and other more sustainable purchases, President Biden and his administration could--if they chose--provide a needed boost in the transition (which is beginning to seem like a complete myth) to a clean energy economy and incentivize the private sector to move in a more sustainable direction.  The 2018 National Climate Assessment found that the climate crisis will slash about a tenth of our economy by the end of the century, and that seems pretty optimistic.  That economic contraction dwarfs any negative impact that strong climate procurement standards could have on any individual firm, although of course you will give first consideration to expanding corporate profits, as always, so I guess that point is moot.  We must, but you won't, use every tool in the toolbox to fight the climate crisis.  I support what President Biden currently states is his rule, although I have no doubt that--like his crowed-about "bipartisan" infrastru

The Biden Administration,  I’m writing to urge the Federal Government to be expansive in its rule minimizing the risk of climate change in federal acquisitions. Climate experts say that we must reduce our carbon emissions dramatically to avoid the worst ravages of the climate crisis. The Federal Government has a unique ability to create market standards through its procurement process. It has a responsibility to make those standards as strong as possible. By making sure that federal purchasing dollars go to greener buildings and materials, lower- and zero-emission vehicles, and other more sustainable purchases, President Biden and his administration can provide a needed boost in the transition to a clean energy economy and incentivize the private sector to move in a more sustainable direction.  The 2018 National Climate Assessment found that the climate crisis could slash about a tenth of our economy by the end of the century. That economic contraction dwarfs any negative impact that strong climate procurement standards could have on an individual firm.  We must use every tool in the toolbox to fight the climate crisis. I support President Biden’s rule.  JEFFREY  MURDOCH retirednavyjeff74@gmail.com 2005 Highland Dr. Camano Island, WA, Washington 98282

The Biden Administration,  The Federal Government can create procurement rules which will fight against climate change.    My wife and I own Midwest farmland, and climate change is affecting our crops.  Fewer rainfall events, but heavier downpours at one time reduce yields and cause more erosion.   These conditions have developed during our lifetimes.  We can see it first hand.  We hope to erect a wind farm turbine on our property to produce renewal energy and diversify our farm income.    Climate experts say that we must reduce our carbon emissions dramatically to avoid the worst ravages of the climate crisis.   ng sure that federal purchasing dollars go to greener buildings and materials, lower- and zero-emission vehicles, and other more sustainable purchases, President Biden and his administration can provide a needed boost in the transition to a clean energy economy and incentivize the private sector to move in a more sustainable direction.  Please....make substantial rules for procurement policies.  Eldon McKie kemckie@gmail.com 420 S. Kirkwood Rd Saint Louis, Missouri 63122
